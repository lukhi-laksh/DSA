# 📘 DSA – Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** repository 👋  
This repo contains my **consistent problem-solving journey**, mainly focused on **LeetCode, NeetCode, patterns, and database problems**, all solved in **Python**.

The repository is structured in a **clean, problem-number–wise format**, making it easy to navigate, learn, and revise.
